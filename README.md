# student_accountability
A project greated for work that keeps track of personnel on an SQL database.

One of my first real C# projects to keep track of student information at work.
The intended purpose was to have a system that keeps track of personal information and medical information. There are areas that still need work and my plan is to keep improving the project. The administration at my place of work rejected the project due to fear of change. Their rejection of it makes it a candidate for public consumption if anyone needs something of this type. I welcome any suggestions for the project or improvements that have been made by anybody that wants to use it as a template.
